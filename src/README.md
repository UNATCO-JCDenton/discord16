## Install
To install the theme you will need to use a discord client that supports custom themes, e.g. [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/), [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
### Using a theme file
- Download [discord16.theme.css](https://github.com/dom1torii/discord16/blob/main/src/discord16.theme.css).
- Put that file into `themes/` folder of your client.
- Enable the theme in your client.

### Using raw theme link
- Copy link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dom1torii/discord16/refs/heads/main/src/discord16.theme.css`
- Paste the link inside online theme import field in your client.
